# TurtleSim Robot Vacuum

This package uses the ROS TurtleSim to simulate a Robot Vacuum Cleaner, based on Udemy's course: [ROS for Beginners: Basics, Motion, and OpenCV](https://www.udemy.com/course/ros-essentials/) by Dr. Anis Koubaa.

Currently there are two available cleaning modes: __grid__ and __spiral__.

## Usage
1. Start the robot simulation: ``roslaunch turtlesim_vacuum vacuum_python``.
2. A menu should pop up in the terminal output. Select (a) for a __grid__ cleaning mode, or (b) for a __spiral__ cleaning mode.
